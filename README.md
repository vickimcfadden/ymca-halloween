## Classroom spooky story 👻
It all started on a dreary fall day when a mummy came out of a house to scare John's mom. He was joined with his friends – 2 skeletons ☠️ and a spider 🕷️. They went for a walk to find John's mom to scare. They hid behind a rock, and when she got close, they jumped out and said "HAPPY HALLOWEEN"!
